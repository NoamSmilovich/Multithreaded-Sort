### Multithreaded Sort

#### Running Instructions:

1. Load the files in the 'src' folder to your favorite IDE.
2. Add 'opencsv-5.7.1' file in the 'additional_dependencies' folder as an additional dependency. 
(You may also delete the part in the code which relies on it, it's sole job is to write the data to a CSV file)
3. You may change the parameters in the main file.
4. Hit 'Run' in your IDE.
>  * If you followed step 2, then a CSV file should contain the simulation's result.
>  * Otherwise the raw results (all the results, without averaging) are printed in the console in a sequential manner.
